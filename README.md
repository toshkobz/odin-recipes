Hello to whoever is reading!

This is my first coding project, which was quite simple and it consisted of making a webpage of a dish whichever first came to mind (PIZZA OBVIOUSLY)

The webpage consisted of a picture of a pizza and a short paragraph under it, just to let people know what it is :D

Then I added a heading with a title of "Ingredients" and listed the ingredients below by using an unordered list.

This was followed by another heading this time for the "Steps" and they were listed with an ordered list, so that i tested both the ordered and unordered lists in the project.

I finalized the project by adding an anchor with a reference to a website with pizza recepies.

In case if anyone wasted their time reading this.. Thanks :D
